=== Observed behaviour ===

Describe in general words the observed behaviour of each of these servers and 
how it affects the video playback experience. Then explain what you believe is
happening and what is causing the described behaviour.

* FUNKY A
The videos seem to stutter when being played on this server and there are slight skipping
of frames when watching the video. This could be caused by packets being lost because it 
seems that frames are being skipped. 

* FUNKY B
The playback of the videos on the server are very choppy and many frames are skipped
which has a negative impact on the video playback experience. This could be caused by
packets being lost because it seems like many frames are being skipped. 

* FUNKY C
The videos on this server seem to be occasionally playing frames in the wrong order and
some frames are played sooner than they should. This could be caused by frames 
arriving in the wrong order and the client doesn't do any reordering, resulting in the
behaviour seen.

* FUNKY D
The videos seem to be choppy and there also seems to be some frames out of order. 
The choppy video can be cause by an unsteady frame rate which is caused by packets being 
sent inconsistently. There also seem to be many out of order frames in the video playback.

* FUNKY E
This server plays the videos extremely fast which makes the video very hard to watch.
The reason the video is being played so fast could be caused by the fact that the server
is sending the packets too fast.

* FUNKY F
This server plays the video at a slower rate than normal which makes the video difficult 
to watch. This is caused by the server sending the packets at a slow but consistent rate.

* FUNKY G
This server plays the videos at a slower rate and is also choppy. This can be cause by the 
server sending the packets at a slower than usual rate and packet loss from the server.

* FUNKY H
The video seems to be choppy and once it starts playing again it speeds up to try and catch up.
This could be caused by the server sending the packets at an uneven rate because there are times
the video playback is choppy and slow and there are times it is very fast.


=== Statistics ===

You may add additional columns with more relevant data.

FUNKY SERVER | FRAME RATE | PACKET LOSS RATE | OUT OF ORDER
             | (pkts/sec) | (lost pkts/sec)  | (/sec)
-------------+------------+------------------+-------------
     A       |   22.89    |       2.30       |     0
     B       |   14.73    |      10.22       |     0
     C       |   25.05    |          0       |     4.40
     D       |   12.72    |      12.02       |     3.13
     E       |   50.20    |      49.55       |     0
     F       |   10.02    |          0       |     0
     G       |    7.81    |       1.96       |     0
     H       |   21.69    |       3.10       |     0

A packet is considered out of order if it arrived later than a packet with higher sequence number.
A manual inspection of the sequence number being recieved were also employed.

=== Result of analysis ===

Explain in a few words what you believe is actually happening based on the statistics above.

* FUNKY A
Based on the statistics, I believe that the stuttering that occurs in funky A is caused by frames being
skipped from packet loss.

* FUNKY B
The choppiness in funky B is caused by the large amount of packet loss that occurs on this server.
This causes a large amount of frames to be skipped.

* FUNKY C
In funky C it appears that the movie is skipping back and forth because there are frames out of order
and that would cause some frames to be played before they should be.

* FUNKY D
Funky D has both packet loss and out of order packets so it appears that video is both choppy and 
skipping back and forth. The packet loss is causing the choppiness and the out of order packets are
causing the skipping.

* FUNKY E
Funky E has a very high frame rate and packet loss rate which resulted in a very short movie that also 
appeared to play very quickly. I think the packet loss is not that obvious because of the high frame
rate. (while coding for part B, we learned the packet loss is actually caused by the client not reading 
the frames sent by the server fast enough).

* FUNKY F
Funky F has a very low frame rate which causes the movie to appear to be in slow motion. It does not
have any packet loss or out of order frames.

* FUNKY G
Funky G has a very low frame rate combined with packet loss so it appears that the movie is playing
in slow motion and is missing some frames.

* FUNKY H
Funky H has some packet loss. Its frame rate should be good enough for viewing. However, from observation
it can be seen that the frama rate is inconsistent. Sometimes it is too fast and sometimes it is too slow.
